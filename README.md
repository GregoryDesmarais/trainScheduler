# Train Scheduler  
A simple application that has the following pages:
index.html - A view-only page.
admin.html - Allows users to add and remove trains from the display.

Both pages will update in real time to show all trains stored in the database.  

The Current Time and Next Arrival Time / Mins will update every minute, to show the next available time, and the minutes remaining before train arrival.
